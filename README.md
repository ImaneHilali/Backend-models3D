Backend for 3D Model Processing and Similarity Search

Implemented a backend using Flask for a 3D model project that processes and stores 3D models and images. It computes key features like principal axes of inertia, moments, and distances, simplifies meshes, and performs similarity searches using cosine similarity. The backend uses MySQL for data storage and handles requests for retrieving, uploading, and comparing models.
